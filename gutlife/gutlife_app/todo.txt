-> save some data to database
-> get date from form and save that to database
-> also the problem of /bm-log/ being empty
Okay all done. Bit of a ropey way of doing it
(refreshing page with JS) but it works. Also
tidied up the date entry format, with a default
of the current date.

Next step will actually be some design work?!?
.. also user accounts actually, which i'm sure
    will require restructuring of the data

If i have to restructure data anyway, it probably makes
more sense to set up user accounts before adding
multiple graphs to the dashboard.. so that is the
next step.

TODO: user accounts.

Okay getting there with the whole frequency thing...
Can now have as many entries as i want in one week.
TODO: tweak back/forward to look cleaner etc

Need to get weekdaytimes and arrange it so that its index order
corresponds to its date order -- to ensure that the entries
are chronologically attached

Okay that done, now need to make sure that all
of weekdaytimes are actually appearing on the graph...
it seems some of the first/last aren't.


Next step:
seems that we need to reformat the date/time thing.
also it seems that weekdayTimes differ from data[i]['time']
values.. must investigate this.
